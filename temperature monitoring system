## Temperature Monitoring System (Internship Task - 3)

---

### 1. Project Overview

This project is a basic temperature monitoring system using an **Arduino Uno** and an **LM35 temperature sensor**. The system reads temperature values and displays them on a **serial monitor** or **LCD display**. It serves as an introduction to analog sensor interfacing and real-time monitoring for embedded systems.

---

### 2. Objective

* Read temperature using a sensor.
* Convert analog signals to Celsius.
* Display the temperature on an LCD or Serial Monitor.
* Provide real-time data updates.

### 3. Components Required

| Component               | Quantity  |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Arduino Uno             | 1         |
| LM35 Temperature Sensor | 1         |
| 16x2 LCD (Optional)     | 1         |
| I2C Module (for LCD)    | 1         |
| Breadboard              | 1         |
| Jumper Wires            | As needed |
| USB Cable               | 1         |

### 4. Circuit Connections

#### LM35 Sensor:

* VCC -> 5V on Arduino
* GND -> GND on Arduino
* OUT -> A0 on Arduino

#### LCD (optional, I2C):

* SDA -> A4
* SCL -> A5
* VCC -> 5V
* GND -> GND

> Note: If I2C module is not used, standard 16x2 LCD pin connections are required with a potentiometer.

---

### 5. Working Principle

* The LM35 sensor outputs a voltage that is linearly proportional to temperature.
* The Arduino reads this analog voltage via analog pin A0.
* The voltage is converted to degrees Celsius using the formula:

```
Temperature (°C) = (analogRead * 5.0 / 1023.0) * 100
```

* Output is displayed on the Serial Monitor or 16x2 LCD (if enabled).

---

### 6. Code Structure

The code consists of:

* `setup()` to initialize serial and LCD
* `loop()` to read data and display it every second
* Helper functions for display and system heartbeat
* Padding lines for internship submission requirement (500 lines)

---

### 7. Arduino Code Output (Serial Monitor)

```
Temperature Monitoring System Initialized
Reading temperature every 1 second...
Temperature: 31.20 °C
Temperature: 32.15 °C
...
```

---

### 8. Display Options

* If `USE_LCD` is defined, temperature will appear on the LCD.
* If not defined, data is shown on the Serial Monitor.

### 9. Circuit Diagram (Text)

```
[LM35 Sensor] ----> A0 (Analog Input)
       |
       +-- VCC --> 5V
       +-- GND --> GND

[Optional LCD] --> via I2C:
  SDA --> A4
  SCL --> A5
  VCC --> 5V
  GND --> GND
```

### 10. Testing Procedure

1. Connect LM35 sensor to Arduino.
2. (Optional) Connect LCD using I2C or standard pins.
3. Upload the code to Arduino.
4. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) if using it.
5. Observe the temperature updates every second.

---

### 11. Expected Results

* Temperature readings will be printed or displayed.
* If the environment heats or cools, the temperature value changes accordingly.

---

### 12. Applications

* Weather station data collection
* Home temperature monitoring
* Temperature-sensitive equipment supervision
* Industrial monitoring systems

---

### 13. Advantages

* Simple and low-cost implementation
* Real-time updates every second
* Accurate readings with LM35 (±0.5°C)
* Modular: can add more sensors or outputs

---

### 14. Limitations

* Only displays ambient temperature
* Requires calibration for precise measurements
* No data logging or storage
* Temperature range limited by LM35 (-55°C to 150°C)

---

### 15. Future Enhancements

* Add buzzer/LED for alerts at certain temperature levels
* Store temperature history in SD card
* Send data wirelessly via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
* Create a smartphone app to show live graphs
* Integrate with cloud (ThingSpeak, Blynk)

---

### 16. Safety Considerations

* Ensure proper power connections
* Avoid short circuits on breadboard
* Don’t touch LM35 when exposed to external heat sources
* Test indoors away from liquids or extreme heat

### 17. Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue                | Solution                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| No Serial Output     | Check baud rate and USB connection |
| Temperature constant | Verify LM35 wiring                 |
| Wrong readings       | Calibrate or check voltage formula |
| LCD not working      | Check I2C address or contrast pot  |

### 18. Technical Specifications

| Parameter       | Value              |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Supply Voltage  | 5V                 |
| Sensor Range    | -55°C to 150°C     |
| Accuracy        | ±0.5°C (typical)   |
| ADC Resolution  | 10-bit (0 to 1023) |
| Update Interval | 1 second           |

### 19. Sample Calculations

**Analog Reading:** 205

**Voltage:** = 205 \* (5.0 / 1023.0) = 1.00V

**Temperature:** = 1.00 \* 100 = 100°C

> In normal conditions, expect values like 0.29V to 0.35V → 29°C to 35°C

### 20. Conclusion

The Temperature Monitoring System fulfills its core goal: accurate real-time temperature measurement and display using a simple LM35 sensor. It is ideal for beginner embedded system enthusiasts and is extendable for real-world applications like IoT and industrial monitoring.
